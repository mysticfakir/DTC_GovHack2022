# Team: Wellbeing Warriors


## SuburbHub
Wellbeing is a difficult quality to measure, particularly when attempting to define the term and break it down into component parts. However, where you live, particularly the space you live in and those that surround you, have a clear impact on wellbeing. With this knowledge in mind, we wanted to make it easier for people to make decisions about where they live, and consequently, their own well-being. 

##### The objective

To assist ACT residents make informed decisions about where to live, using existing data sets publicly available from the ACT government. 
Our SuburbHub app alleviates some of the stress involved with moving, allowing citizens to identify priority traits of a suburb and better make the trade-off between outside spaces and artificial infrastructure whilst awaiting policy change.

##### Problems we have identified

-	As the population increases, individual’s access to green spaces will decrease.
-	There is a nexus between access to greenspaces and one’s mental/physical wellbeing.
-	The Ratio of greenspaces should be measured by per capita instead of percentage of land area.

##### Our policy recommendations

1. Population growth control measures are implemented to ensure that populations within any region does not exceed planned capacity.
2. A government decentralisation strategy is established to decouple growth of Australian Public Service from the growth of the Australian Capital Territory
3. All new developments are designed with green space to support a maximum capacity that will not be exceeded by urban intensification efforts.

HOW SUBURBHUB SOLVES THIS PROBLEM 
-	SuburbHub is an app that aims to help people decide which suburb is most ideal based on one's individual preferences such as location, accessibility, and availability of green spaces. 

-	Suburb Hub will enable individuals to move into a space that will be beneficial to their well-being. We recognise that no induvial has the same needs and values and so our application will disperse the population into areas where they are most comfortable and happy. 

-	Suburb Hub will encourage individuals to identify what they value in terms of residential dwellings, which also acts as valuable feedback to the government. The data collected from Suburb Hub can enable discussion making surrounding the allocation of funds towards public facilities and community spaces.

It is our intention that once our policy recommendations have been implemented, citizens will have equitable access to green space, removing the need to trade-off access to green spaces with other individual needs. At this time, the option to prioritise green space can be removed from the app.
SPECIFIC FEATURES OF SUBURBHUB 
1. Create a profile using a variety of questions  
2. Order your preferences of facilities/spaces in terms of how important they are to you.  
3. Generate a result of what areas are most suitable for you to live in based on the information given when creating the profile.  
4. Provides a detailed snapshot of what is available in these areas and where the individual’s wellbeing will benefit the most.
